In step 2, we create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM) with 2-4 virtual CPU's inside Azure. We will also allow the Virtual Machine to create a new virtual network (Vnet). We will then create a username and password of our choice. This username and password will be used for the Remote Desktop function we are using to access the virtual machine we just created.

In step 3, we open the Remote Desktop Connection app on our computer. A remote desktop is an internet-enabled program or operating system feature that lets someone access a computer from a different location, just as if they were interacting with the device locally. We will be using this to connect to the Virtual Machine we created in Azure.
